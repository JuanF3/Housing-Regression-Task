# California Housing Value Prediction

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting housing values in California. Utilizing a detailed dataset on demographic and geographic characteristics, we aim to provide accurate estimates of property values, which can be useful for real estate agencies, buyers, sellers, and other stakeholders in the housing market.

## Dataset
The project is based on the well-known "California Housing" dataset, which contains information on various characteristics of different districts in California. The main features of the dataset include:

* Median Age of Houses.
* Average Household Income.
* Total Population of the District.
* Total Number of Households.
* Total Number of Rooms.
* Total Number of Bedrooms.
* Proximity to the Ocean (categories like: "inland", "near ocean", "near bay").
* Median House Value (target variable).
